# EDU-Project

This is a research project I am working on with a professor in College of Education.<br>

The main purpose of this project is to investigate the relationship between gender and mathematical logic.
While the main research targets are elementary school students, we decide to do the reasearch in a game form using Unity3D.
Not only do we make it as a PC game, our goal is to make it as a mobile game(in both Android and iOS engine),
and eventually make it as a VR game.<br>

To play the game on a PC or laptop, you need to download the full "Game_Source" folder and run "Project_EDU.exe".
